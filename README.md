### Overview
ChessGate's an activity which I made for the college in the web programming subject. The project consists in a simple e-commerce application. The theme of the e-commerce is a chess items store. 

### Technologies
The system was made with simple scripts of PHP on back end, Javascript with JQuery library, HTML and CSS for front end. I didn't use any aspects of OOP neither a software design pattern.

### Usage
To run the application on your machine you must use some kind of web server of your taste, like Apache or Nginx (I'd recommend my favorite one: Lighttpd) and a DBMS such as MySQL or MariaDB.

Then you must import the database file called ```base_dados.sql``` (it's on the BD folder) on your DBMS.

After all, you must put the project folder into your web server application folder. If you follow these steps corretcly, then you could access the web application browsing on the localhost.
